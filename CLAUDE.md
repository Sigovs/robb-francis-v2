# Rob Francis Sports Cars

> Built to Alex's design system. The rules are **not vendored here** — they are
> resolved live, so this project never drifts from a stale copy.

# DESIGN DNA

**Read before producing anything visual** — a page, a component, a scene, CSS,
tokens, an image — and before any art direction, palette, type scale, spacing
ramp, motion or composition decision.

1. `/Users/alex/Desktop/WORK/design_dna/TASTE.md`
   — the manifest: operating rules, the two tiers, the Design Read, the dialect index.
2. `/Users/alex/Desktop/WORK/design_dna/.claude/rules/design-dna.md`
   — the build standard, `DNA1`–`DNA94`.
3. `/Users/alex/Desktop/WORK/design_dna/skills` — load the skills the task actually touches.
4. Fallback if this machine has no working copy: https://github.com/Sigovs/design_dna

**Say which path resolved, in one line, at the top of the report.**

## For scroll-driven or cinematic work

Load the **`scroll-site`** skill first. It carries the stack, the scaffold, the
concept gate and the definition of done.

## Stack

**Lenis ships on this project (`DNA90`)**, off under reduced motion, on one
loop with GSAP when GSAP is present.

## The concept gate

**`BRIEF.md` is complete before the first line of markup (`DNA1`).** An empty
section in it is an unfinished gate, not a detail to fill in later.

## Order of authority

1. Truth and access — contrast, provenance, reduced motion, discoverability.
2. `TASTE.md` and the INVARIANT tier of the skills.
3. The build standard, `DNA1`–`DNA94`.
4. The selected dialect, and this project's own direction below.
5. Plugins — `frontend-design`, Scrollcraft, `threejs-webgl`,
   `gsap-scrolltrigger`. **Reference only. They bind nothing** and are never the
   reason for a design decision. Neither is a library name.

## Working style

Never ask yes/no or confirmation questions to resolve taste — make the senior
call and note it in the report. Questions about **facts** — scope, content,
constraints, contradictions, missing assets — are expected. Three at most.

## Project direction

_A project direction is a brief executed inside the invariants, never instead of
them. Write it here: the business goal, the audience, what must not change._

Redesign of rfsportscars.com as a high-end collection site with a California
location. Content comes only from the live site and the Facebook page. Sources
and dates are in `BRIEF.md §0`.

**Must not change:** the navigation. Home · Inventory · Financing · About Us ·
Consignment · Virtual Tour · Contact Us, plus the utility bar (phone, By
Appointment Only, "We buy cars", My Collection).
**Adds:** a Sold Inventory section.
**Wish:** full motion, video, rotation, interactivity (scroll-site route).
